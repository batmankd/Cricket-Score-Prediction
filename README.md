# Cricket-Score-Prediction

The traditional cricket score prediction was developed based on the
 algorithm called Winning and Score Predictor (WASP). The algorithm
 considers various factors to simulate future outcomes based on the
 historical data and few match scenario(such location, weather & etc.).

 A cricket score prediction system using reinforcement learning (RL) and
 deep learning combines advanced AI techniques to make accurate,
 dynamic match forecasts. The system leverages deep learning to analyze vast historical and real
time data, such as player stats, weather, and pitch conditions.
 Q-learning & Deep Q-Networks then adapts predictions as the match
 progresses, learning optimal strategies based on each ballâ€™s outcome.
 We use custom accuracy algorithm which improves the prediction of
 the DL model. By continuously learning from match scenarios, the model can deliver
 more precise and context-sensitive score predictions.
